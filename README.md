🚀 Live Now: Credit Transfer Checker

Proud to launch my CSE 302 (Database Systems) project — now live at 🔎https://lnkd.in/enMf_EkE 🎉

💡 Through this project, I have successfully completed basic Django development and database integration.

A Django + MySQL web app to compare and match course credits across top Bangladeshi universities — NSU, BRACU, EWU, IUB, AIUB.

👨‍💻Tech: VScode | Django | MySQL (Clever Cloud) | GitHub | Render

Features:
✅ Compare course credits between universities
✅ Clean, user-friendly interface

📌 This is not the final version — more updates are coming, and development is still in progress!
